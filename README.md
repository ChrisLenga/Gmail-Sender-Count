# Gmail-Sender-Count

This is a simple script that when run will generate a log of senders by how many emails are in the Gmail Inbox based on the senders' email.

You'll run this script directly from https://script.google.com/home.

My specific use case for making this was to clean up my email inbox which had nearly 40,000 messages in it. Below is an example of the output you'll see when running it. For privacy reasons, I blurred out the emails in the log.

If you're using this to clean up a massively overfilled inbox you will have to run this multiple times (due to rate limits) after deleting emails. This is due to Google rate limits on running scripts and the time it takes for the script to process through an inbox.
