# Gmail-Sender-Count

This is a simple script that when run will generate a log of senders by how many emails are in the Gmail Inbox based on the senders' email. If you're using this to clean up a massively overfilled inbox you will have to run this multiple times (due to rate limits) after deleting emails. 

You'll run this script directly from https://script.google.com/home.
